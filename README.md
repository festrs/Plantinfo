#**Plantinfo** [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/festrs/Plantinfo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/festrs/Plantinfo) [![codebeat badge](https://codebeat.co/badges/f4239007-937f-44b7-942f-4e5eaf8c8619)](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-festrs-plantinfo)

This project was created as a final paper for the graduation program, of system information at [PUCRS](http://www.pucrs.br/), the goal is to improve the plants classification process and reduce the time at same time. Because of some limitations like, the lack amount images classified of plants and the great quantity of plants, I kept my focus in a specific group of plants, the poisonous or toxic plants.

# Body (conte√∫do)

This work consists of using deep learning methods for image recognition of plants. The Caffe library was used to generate the prediction model.
