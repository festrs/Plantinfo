The numerous cultivars offer foliage colors in red, salmon, rose, white, or green with many variegated combinations. Their flower is a spadix surrounded by a yellow-green spathe.  Caladiums prefer a rich soil and shade. Grown mostly for their interesting foliage display, caladiums perform well in garden borders and containers. Fertilize them once a month with 8-8-8 (2 lbs/100 ft2 ). Caladiums do not overwinter in N.C. Therefore, their tubers must be dug in the fall and stored dry at 70 to 75 °F. The tubers are replanted in the spring after the last chance of frost.
